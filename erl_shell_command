rd(RecordName, RecordDefinition)
Defines a record in the shell.

RecordName is an atom and RecordDefinition lists the field names and the default values.
Usually record definitions are made known to the shell by use of the rr/1,2,3 commands described below,
but sometimes it is handy to define records on the fly.


rl() 	  /// rf(RecordNames)
PRINT all record definitions.


rf()      ///  rf(RecordNames)
REMoVE all record definitions, then reads record definitions from
the modules shell_default and user_default (if loaded). 
Returns the names of the records defined.


rp(Term) lets you convert a tuple to a record (given the definition exists)
